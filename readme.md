# Web video player
A **challenging** video player with style

## Overview
This project uses *VueJs 2* powered by *Webpack 2*

Styles by *Stylus*

## Features

Optimized for **Chrome, Firefox and Safari** -*sorry IE ;) maybe next update*-

The web is **responsive**

It features a demo button to **toggle text direction** from left-to-right and right-to-left

This feature **works for close captions as well!**

If you wish to change the movie info -or the url to the video- there is a *config.json* file for that. Bear in mind you should **run webpack** again to compile those changes.

In **Safari** a different (native) video is played.
