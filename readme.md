# Web video player
A challenging video player with style

## Overview
This project uses VueJs 2 powered by Webpack 2

Styles by stylus

Optimized for Chrome, Firefox and Safari -sorry IE ;) maybe next update-

It features a demo button to toggle direction of the text from left-to-right and right-to-left

This feature works for close captions as well

If you wish to change the movie -or the video- there is a config.json file for that. Bear in mind you should run webpack again to see those changes.
